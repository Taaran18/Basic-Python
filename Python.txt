- Developed by Guido Van Rossum
- Python is a high-level programming language.
- It is and intendation language. (It's not like Java or C++)
- Known for its simplicity and readability.
- Widely used for Web Development, Data Analysis, AI, and Scientific Computing.
- Elegant syntax with minimalistic and easy-to-understand code structures.
- Supports multiple programming paradigms: procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.
- Vast standard library and a vibrant community.
- Extensive ecosystem of third-party libraries and frameworks.
- Code -> Translator (Interpreter) -> Machine Code (0/1)


# Python Character Set
- Letter -> A-Z, a-z
- Digits -> 0-9
- Special Symbols ->  !"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\]
- Whitespaces -> Blankspace, tab, carriage return, newline, formfeed


# Keywords
- Reserved words in a programming language.
- They have predefined meanings and cannot be used as identifiers.
- Play crucial roles in defining the syntax and structure of a program.
- Examples in Python include `if`, `else`, `for`, `while`, `def`, `class`, `import`, `return`, `True`, `False`, `None`, etc.
- Facilitate Control Flow, defining Functions and Classes, Importing Modules, and more.


# Comments
- Comments in Python are non-executable lines used to annotate code for better understanding.
- They are ignored by the interpreter during program execution.
- Comments start with the `#` symbol and extend to the end of the line.
- Comments can be used to document code, explain functionality, or temporarily disable code.
- They enhance code readability and maintainability for both the original developer and collaborators.
