# Conditional Statements
- It are used to execute different code blocks based on specified conditions.
- They allow a program to make decisions and control the flow of execution.
- The main types of conditional statements in Python are:
  1. if statement -> Executes a block of code if a specified condition is true.
  2. if-else statement -> Executes one block of code if the condition is true and another block if it is false.
  3. if-elif-else statement -> Allows checking multiple conditions and executing different blocks of code accordingly.
- Conditional statements are crucial for implementing logic and branching within programs.
- Syntax ->
            if(condition):
                Statement1
            elif(condition):
                Statement2
            else:
                Statement3


# Ternary Operator -
- It is a concise way to write conditional expressions.
- It is also known as the conditional expression.
- It evaluates the condition, and if true, returns the value of `x`, otherwise returns the value of `y`.
- The ternary operator is often used as a shorthand for simple if-else statements.
- It helps improve code readability by reducing the number of lines for simple conditional assignments and avoid complex expression.
- Syntax (Single Line)->
            <var> = <val1> if <condition> else <val2>
            <Statement1> if <condition> else <Statement2>
- Syntax (CleverIf Line)->
            <var> = (false_val, true_val) [<condition>]
